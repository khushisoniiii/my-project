Study shows that youth today is more prone to distress. They easily feel vulnerable, upset and discouraged which ends up taking a wrong career decision. They get highly disappointed and depressed when they feel that what turns to be fruitful for their peers has not worked well for them</p>
        <p>So, before you or your child indulge herself in this whole process of stress and anxiety, its best to get career-related problems resolved by taking help from a career counselor. Research says that youngsters, who made better career choices, grew mentally stronger and successful</p>
