        <h1> Home Tuition</h1>
        <p>It's impossible to avoid decision making from deciding which home tutor is best for you.
             There are various pros and cons of learning in a group and learning privately.
              It has a very little scope for distraction and keeps you controlled and in your comfort zone.</p>
             
              <h2>Challenges</h2>
             <p>Home tuition is not easy to find and major challenges that parents/students faced while on a
                 hunt for a decent home tutor are</p>
            <p><b>Search - </b>The most challenging, annoying and time- consuming part is 'the search' calling friends,
                 using the internet, contact institutes, etc. it is tedious and exhausting. At that time you have 
                 a list of home tutors in Patna but it's difficult to decide which home tutor is best for me.</p>
                 <p><b>Compatibility with the student -</b> It's very hard to fi a home tutor who is versatile, passionate,
                     and compassionate. That's why our Siksha helps in decision making which home tutor is best.</p>
                     <p><b>Confusion and internet -</b> It is seemingly easy to type the word 'Home Tuition in Patna' and 
                        search randomly on the internet but it is going to get complicated and confusing eventually. 
                        The information you get on the internet is unfiltered and raw and there is no assurance or
                         security.</p>
                         <p><b>Budget -</b> If you have somehow found the right tutor you might have to shell out a few
                             extra bucks from your pocket and that could stir your budget.so it's better to find
                              home tuition that is worth it for you.</p>
                              <p><b>Subjects -</b> every year a new course and syllabus is introduced with so many new 
                                courses and subjects being taught in schools and colleges, it gets really difficult
                                 to find a tutor for some subjects who have advance knowledge of these courses.</p>
